# ASSGN_SKYLARK
The Assignment folder contains two codes written :
i) pythonscript.py
ii) 1intro.py

The problem is to research, formulate andÂ  implement a program to detect the GCPs within an image. The images are also provided in the Assignment folder.

Step no.1 is to run the pythonscript.py.This code will create images of mark.jpg rotated from 0 degree to 360 degree each with a interval of 0.5 degree. Now we have a dataset of 720 images to compare and we know these all are GCP's.

Step no.2 is to run 1intro.py. This code contains list of all the images in which we  need to find the GCPs. It takes all of the images one by one and compare them with the datasets we created and if Image matches more than the accuracy of 85% it returns the coordinates.

The work flow diagram is explained in the folder WORKFLOW.
